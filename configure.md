# Configure your Server

Now that you have all the basic requirements to run the PhishDetect Node daemon, you need to more appropriately configure your server in order to expose the service to the public.

At this point, you should have a `phishdetect-node` running and operating on host 127.0.0.1 and on port 7856 (or any other port you might have configured). Next, you should decide which web server to install and configure as proxy to PhishDetect Node and particularly make sure that your SSL/TLS configuration is solid.
